            <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and
               Python. </p>
               
            <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Fr端h 
                (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>

                <code> var fr端h = "foobar"</code>

            <p>But, the variable fr端h is not the same as Fr端h because JavaScript is case sensitive.
               In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).
                            
            <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more 
               than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. 
               ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, 
               see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) It is considered best practice, however, 
               to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces 
               the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
                            
            <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted
               into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, 
               comments, or whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is 
                            case-sensitive, <code>null</code> is not the same as <code>Null</code>, <code>NULL</code>, 
                            or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.</li>
                        <li>Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: <code>42</code> 
                            or <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
                        <li>String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful 
            functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental 
            elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, 
            and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditional_statements">
            <header><h2>Conditional statements</h2></header>

            <p>A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition 
            is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements:<code> if...else</code> 
            and<code> switch</code>.</p>

            <h3>if...else statement</h3>
            
            <p>Use the <code>if</code> statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. 
            Use the optional <code>else</code> clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. 
            An <code>if</code> statement looks as follows:</p>

                <code>if (condition) { <br>
                        statement_1; <br>
                      } else {  <br>
                        statement_2; <br>
                      }</code>

            <p>Here the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See 
            Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates
            to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and 
            statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested 
            in sequence, as follows:</p>

                <code>if (condition_1) { <br>
                        statement_1;    <br>
                      } else if (condition_2) { <br>
                        statement_2;    <br>
                      } else if (condition_n) { <br>
                        statement_n;    <br>
                      } else {  <br>
                        statement_last; <br>
                      } </code>

            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to 
            true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement 
            ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when 
            nesting if statements:</p>

            <code>if (condition) { <br>
                    statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br>
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; <br>
                  } else { <br>
                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>
                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; <br>
                  }</code>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header> <h2>Functions</h2> </header>

            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) 
                consists of the function keyword, followed by: </p>
            <ul>                
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>

        <code>function square(number) { <br>
                return number * number; <br>
              }</code>

        <p>The function <strong>square</strong> takes one parameter, called <strong>number</strong>. 
        The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function 
        (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The statement return specifies the value returned by the function.</p>


        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Loops_and_iteration">
            <header> <h2>Loops and iteration</h2> </header>

            <p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to 
            take X steps in one direction then Y steps in another; for example, the idea "Go five steps 
            to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>

            <code>var step; <br>
                    for (step = 0; step < 5; step++) { <br>
                      // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4. <br>
                      console.log('Walking east one step'); <br>
                    }</code>

            <p>There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: 
            they repeat an action some number of times (and it's actually possible that number could 
            be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end 
            points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of 
            loop over the others.</p>

            <p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>for statement</li>
                <li>do...while statement</li>
                <li>while statement</li>
                <li>labeled statement</li>
                <li>break statement</li>
                <li>continue statement</li>
                <li>for...in statement</li>
                <li>for...of statement</li>
            </ul>
